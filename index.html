            <p>Your boss wants to know the top 10 video games of all time or top 10 for a specific year.
              Answer: The first graph provides a dropdown button that gives all provided years in the
              excel sheet. The boss can select All, which will show the top 10 video games of all time
              based on Global Sales, or the top 10, or top games if there aren't 10 for that year, for
              the chosen year.</p>

            <p>Your boss wants to understand which genre is most popular. We'd like to see genre sales broken out per region.
              (This question can be answered by showing the top genre in each region if you want to implement a map, otherwise
              you should show genre sales broken down by region in bar/scatter/line/pie etc.)
              Here, we use a tree map which visually displays the relative sizes of the sales per genre, for the top 5 genres,
              in the four regions: US, Europe, Japan, and Other. I have included a tool tip that shows the total global sales value
              for each genre. It should be visually clear and also with the numbers, which genre is the most popular per region.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, your boss wants to know which publisher to pick based on which genre a game is.
              Your chart should provide a clear top publisher for each genre (could be interactive or statically show).
              Here, I use a bar chart to show the the total global sales for the top publisher in their genre, with
              then name being displayed for the top publisher next to the bar chart, and the genre on the y axis,
              and the global sales value on the bottom.

              2. D3 is a useful library for making the data flow from data parsing to inputting it into a graph type
              a very simple process. It has a lot of built-in types of graphs that don't have to be coded from scratch.
              In terms of practicality and utility, d3 is very well documented and commonly used, so examples are readily
              available and easy to comprehend and learn from.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Because data is so complex, it can be limiting to try to fit data into the necessary form that is required for
              the default d3 built-in graphs. In some contexts, it is better to just build a graph from scratch. d3 is also
              complex and very robust in terms of how many options there are, so in that sense, it can be overwhelming for
              both the person writing the code and for the user, who can be overwhelmed with over-specified graph features.
              Visualization without standard graphs, and using something more expressive can be a reason to not use d3.

              4. My tree map is perhaps more helpful for the visually impaired in terms of just looking at opacity and seeing
              size as a comparison of amount of sales. I also use white space in between to make the rectangles distinct.
              Bar graphs also utilize distinct size. However, my graphs use a lot of small text, and while I do have some
              tool tips for the tree map, the others are limited in this aspect. Color may also be an issue for the color blind,
              and the bar and tree maps are not necessary the most intuitive to be read back for someone who is fully blind.
              I could make sharper outlines in my graphs and sharper colors as opacity may be helpful for some, but not for
              those with protanopia, who may not be able to as clearly differentiate, as described by Accessible Data
              Visualization.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. It can be difficult to accommodate all aspects of visual aid, for example with the use of opacity for
              tree maps, because for general visual purposes, it can be a good indicator of the value and can be used
              as another visual aid if rectangle sizes aren't clear enough. Just using bar graphs for the other two may
              not be the best, particularly for answering the last question, because it can be helpful for the people who
              are blind to just having clear, readable text for the publisher for each genre, but I personally wasn't sure
              whether that would be too limiting as a display of information, and the bar graph can also show a comparison
              between genres besides just the top publisher.
